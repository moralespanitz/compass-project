Here's a detailed evaluation strategy PRD for implementing a query optimizer system like COMPASS:

# Query Optimizer Evaluation Strategy PRD

## 1. Benchmark Setup

### 1.1 Dataset Requirements
- Use established benchmark dataset (e.g., IMDB)
- Data characteristics:
  - Multiple tables with varying sizes
  - Complex relationships between tables
  - Mix of data distributions
  - Real-world data patterns

### 1.2 Query Workload
- Number of queries: 100+ 
- Query complexity categories:
  - Simple (4-9 joins)
  - Moderate (10-19 joins)
  - Complex (20+ joins)
- Must include:
  - Selection predicates
  - Join conditions
  - Multiple table combinations

## 2. Comparative Systems

### 2.1 Baseline Systems
- Open-source databases:
  - PostgreSQL
  - MonetDB
- Your implementation
- At least one commercial system if possible

### 2.2 System Configuration
- Identical hardware setup
- Standardized settings:
  - Memory allocation
  - Buffer sizes
  - Optimization parameters
- Documented configurations for reproducibility

## 3. Evaluation Metrics

### 3.1 Plan Quality Metrics
- Cardinality estimation accuracy:
  - Estimated vs actual cardinalities
  - Error distribution analysis
  - Relative error calculations

### 3.2 Performance Metrics
- Query execution time
- Optimization overhead
- Total workload runtime
- Resource utilization:
  - CPU usage
  - Memory consumption
  - I/O operations

### 3.3 Plan Consistency Metrics
- L1 distance measurement:
  ```
  L1 = Î£|Si - Ci|
  where:
  Si = Position in system's ordering
  Ci = Position in correct ordering
  ```
- Normalized L1 distance:
  ```
  NormL1 = L1 / number_of_subplans
  ```

## 4. Evaluation Methodology

### 4.1 Plan Quality Analysis
1. For each query:
   - Collect execution plans from all systems
   - Extract intermediate result cardinalities
   - Compute estimation errors
   - Record plan structure and ordering

2. Comparative analysis:
   - Rank plans by cardinality
   - Calculate L1 distances
   - Identify optimal vs suboptimal plans

### 4.2 Performance Analysis
1. Runtime measurements:
   - Multiple execution runs (minimum 9)
   - Record median values
   - Calculate variance

2. Overhead assessment:
   - Measure optimization time
   - Track resource usage
   - Monitor system metrics

### 4.3 Statistical Validation
- Confidence intervals (95%)
- Error bounds
- Statistical significance tests
- Variance analysis

## 5. Result Collection & Analysis

### 5.1 Data Collection
```sql
CREATE TABLE evaluation_results (
    query_id INT,
    system_name VARCHAR,
    estimated_cardinality DECIMAL,
    actual_cardinality DECIMAL,
    optimization_time MS,
    execution_time MS,
    plan_cost DECIMAL,
    l1_distance DECIMAL
);
```

### 5.2 Analysis Categories
1. Plan quality comparison:
   - Win ratio per system
   - Error distribution
   - L1 distance distribution

2. Performance analysis:
   - Runtime comparison
   - Overhead analysis
   - Resource efficiency

3. Workload analysis:
   - Cumulative metrics
   - Query complexity impact
   - System reliability

## 6. Visualization & Reporting

### 6.1 Required Visualizations
1. Error distribution plots
2. L1 distance comparison
3. Runtime comparison charts
4. Resource utilization graphs
5. Cumulative performance plots

### 6.2 Report Structure
1. Executive Summary
2. Methodology Details
3. Individual Query Analysis
4. Aggregate Results
5. Statistical Analysis
6. Conclusions
7. Recommendations

## 7. Success Criteria

### 7.1 Accuracy Metrics
- L1 distance below baseline systems
- Cardinality estimation error < 10x
- Consistent plan quality across complexity levels

### 7.2 Performance Targets
- Runtime improvement > 20%
- Optimization overhead < 500ms (GPU)
- Optimization overhead < 5s (CPU)
- Successful execution of all queries

### 7.3 Statistical Validation
